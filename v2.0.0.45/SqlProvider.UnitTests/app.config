	<!--  DYNAMIC DEBUG COMPILATION
          Set compilation debug="true" to enable ASPX debugging.  Otherwise, setting this value to
          false will improve runtime performance of this application. 
          Set compilation debug="true" to insert debugging symbols (.pdb information)
          into the compiled page. Because this creates a larger file that executes
          more slowly, you should set this value to true only when debugging and to
          false at all other times. For more information, refer to the documentation about
          debugging ASP.NET files. -->

	<!--  AUTHENTICATION 
          This section sets the authentication policies of the application. Possible modes are "Windows", 
          "Forms", "Passport" and "None"

          "None" No authentication is performed. 
          "Windows" IIS performs authentication (Basic, Digest, or Integrated Windows) according to 
           its settings for the application. Anonymous access must be disabled in IIS. 
          "Forms" You provide a custom form (Web page) for users to enter their credentials, and then 
           you authenticate them in your application. A user credential token is stored in a cookie.
          "Passport" Authentication is performed via a centralized authentication service provided
           by Microsoft that offers a single logon and core profile services for member sites. -->
		<authentication mode="Windows" />
		<!--  AUTHORIZATION 
          This section sets the authorization policies of the application. You can allow or deny access
          to application resources by user or role. Wildcards: "*" mean everyone, "?" means anonymous 
          (unauthenticated) users. -->

		<!--  CUSTOM ERROR MESSAGES
			Set customErrors mode="On" or "RemoteOnly" to enable custom error messages, "Off" to disable. 
			Add <error> tags for each of the errors you want to handle.

			"On" Always display custom (friendly) messages.
			"Off" Always display detailed ASP.NET error information.
			"RemoteOnly" Display custom (friendly) messages only to users not running 
			on the local Web server. This setting is recommended for security purposes, so 
			that you do not display application detail information to remote clients.-->
