    <title>About CAPTCHA</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>
        We apologize for the inconvenience, but the wiki often comes under a barrage of
        automated <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog_spam'>comment spam</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our solution is to employ <a href='http://www.captcha.net/'>CAPTCHA</a> to help
        block automated spamming of the wiki.</p>
    <p>
        By reading the image and typing in the code that you see, you give us a little bit
        of proof that you are indeed a human submitting a comment, as opposed to a script
        sending hundreds of little spam comments.</p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, CAPTCHA makes it tough for visually-impaired readers to post comments.
        If you are having trouble with the CAPTCHA image, and would like to edit the wiki,
        please contact the wiki administrator. Thanks for your understanding!</p>
